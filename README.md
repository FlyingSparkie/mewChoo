# mewChoo
Designed Mew Choo in Blender then imported to Processing using simulation of Flocking

make a folder in processing called mewchoo(just to remember where it is). copy all the files into that folder. 
Open Processing then select open file, then select Flocking.pde.
Once open and running use mouse for camera movement(left for gimbal, middle for move, right for size, scroll mouse for zoom)

it's not perfect but it demonstrates using an imported obj file for use in Processing - you don't have to have all those mewchoos'.
